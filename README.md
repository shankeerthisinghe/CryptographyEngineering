# Homomorphic
This code is an implementation of a simple RSA encryption scheme that demonstrates the homomorphic property of the RSA algorithm for multiplication. 
Homomorphic encryption allows specific types of computations to be carried out on ciphertexts and obtaining an encrypted result, which, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.
