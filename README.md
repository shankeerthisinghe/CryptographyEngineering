# Homomorphic
This code is an implementation of a simple RSA encryption scheme that demonstrates the homomorphic property of the RSA algorithm for multiplication. 
Homomorphic encryption allows specific types of computations to be carried out on ciphertexts and obtaining an encrypted result, which, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.

The code showcases how the RSA algorithm maintains its homomorphic properties for multiplication, meaning that the product of two encrypted numbers, when decrypted, equals the product of the original plaintext numbers. This is illustrated by encrypting two random numbers, multiplying the encrypted values, decrypting the result, and verifying it matches the direct multiplication of the plaintext numbers.
